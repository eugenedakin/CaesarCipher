# CaesarCipher
Native Xojo code for the Caesar Cipher algorithm with an example program

This is a great start to learning cipher algorithms by using the Xojo programming language and the Caesar Cipher. This is written in Native Xojo Language and is cross-platform-compatible.
 - Compatible OS's: All
 - Xojo IDE: 2020 r2.1
 - Xojo API: API 2
 - Level: Beginner

Code for this example is in the following two methods: 1) CaesarCipherEncode, and 2) CaesarCipherDecode

Instructions:

 - Run the program in Xojo 2020 r2.1
 - Enter your text in the Upper-Left TextArea Control
 - Press Encrypt to use the Caesar Cipher Algorithm and the encoded text will appear in the control in the Upper-Right TextArea Control
 - To decrypt the message, place the encoded message in the Lower-Left Control
 - Press the Decrypt button
 - The decrypted message will then appear in the Lower-Right Control

The Methods can be copied and pasted to use in your program. This is written in native Xojo code.

An article was written in xDev (xdevmag.com) Issue 19.3 (May/June 2021) that describes the Xojo code.
